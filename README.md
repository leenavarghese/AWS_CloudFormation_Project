## ABOUT THE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to go through an exercise of writing a CloudFormation template for below architected application. In this exercise, I learned the following:
* Writing a template structure
* Parameterize the CF template
* Mapping values
* Writing resource blocks
* Outputs to be used within CF and passing values to other stacks

## ARCHITECTURE
